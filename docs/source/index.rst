Welcome to msp2db's documentation!
==================================

Python package to create an SQLite database from a collection of MSP mass spectromertry spectra files. Currently works with MSP files formated as  `MassBank records <https://github.com/MassBank/MassBank-data>`__
or as  `MoNA records <http://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/downloads>`__.

The resulting SQLite database can be used for spectral matching with    `msPurity Bioconductor R package <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/msPurity.html>`__, see `vigenette. <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/msPurity/inst/doc/msPurity-spectral-matching-vignette.html>`__
